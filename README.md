# Project: Mastermind - Shannon Clark

This is an object-oriented Ruby assignment from [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com). The aim of this project is to create a command-line implementation of the board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) in order to practice with object-oriented software development principles.

## How to run the game
You can download this project by cloning the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/theshannonclark/project_cli_mastermind.git mastermind
```

Then change into the resulting directory:

```
cd mastermind
```

Finally, run the game:

```
ruby main.rb
```
